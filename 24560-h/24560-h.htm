<h2>A Day Dream</h2>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
Polly&#8217;s patchwork&mdash;oh, dear me!&mdash;<br />
Truly is a sight to see.<br />
Rumpled, crumpled, soiled, and frayed&mdash;<br />
Will the quilt be ever made?<br />
See the stitches yawning wide&mdash;<br />
Can it be that Polly <em>tried</em>?</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Some are right and some are wrong,<br />
Some too short and some too long,<br />
Some too loose and some too tight;<br />
Grimy smudges on the white,<br />
And a tiny spot of red,<br />
Where poor Polly&#8217;s finger bled.<br />
Strange such pretty, dainty blocks&mdash;<br />
Bits of Polly&#8217;s summer frocks&mdash;<br />
Should have proved so hard to sew,<br />
And the cause of so much woe!</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
One day it was <em>very</em> hot,<br />
And the thread got in a knot,<br />
Drew the seam up in a heap&mdash;<br />
Polly calmly fell asleep.<br />
Then she had a lovely dream;<br />
Straight and even was the seam,<br />
Pure and spotless was the white;<br />
All the blocks were finished quite&mdash;<br />
Each joined to another one.<br />
Lo, behold! the quilt was done,&mdash;<br />
Lined and quilted,&mdash;and it seemed<br />
To cover Polly as she dreamed!</p>

There lived in ancient Scribbletown a wise old writer-man,<br />
Whose name was Homer Cicero Demosthenes McCann.<br />
He&#8217;d written treatises and themes till, &ldquo;For a change,&rdquo; he said,<br />

He pulled down all his musty tomes in Latin and in Greek;<br />
Consulted cyclop&aelig;dias and manuscripts antique,<br />
Essays in Anthropology, studies in counterpoise&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;For these,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are useful lore for little girls and boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 7em;">
He scribbled hard, and scribbled fast, he burned the midnight oil,<br />
And when he reached &ldquo;The End&rdquo; he felt rewarded for his toil;<br />
He said, &ldquo;This charming Children&#8217;s Book is greatly to my credit.&rdquo;<br />
And now he&#8217;s sorely puzzled that no child has ever read it.</p>

<h2>The Very Merry Voyage of the Macaroni Man</h2>


<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
This figure here before you is a Macaroni Man,<br />
Who is built, as you may notice, on a most ingenious plan.<br />
His skeleton, I beg to state, is made of hairpins three,<br />
Which are bent and curved and twisted to a marvellous degree.<br />
His coat-sleeves and his trouser-legs, his head and eke his waist<br />
Are made of superfine imported macaroni paste.<br />
And if you care to listen, you may hear the thrilling tale<br />
Of the merry Macaroni Man&#8217;s extraordinary sail.<br />
One sunny day he started for a voyage in his yacht,<br />
His anxious mother called to him, and said, &ldquo;You&#8217;d better not!<br />
Although the sun is shining bright, I fear that it may rain;<br />
And don&#8217;t you think, my darling boy, you&#8217;d better take the train?&rdquo;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;no clouds I see,&mdash;the sky is blue and clear,<br />
I will return in time for tea&mdash;good-by, my mother  dear.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 299px;">
<img src="images/img38-1.png" width="299" height="200" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
Full merrily he started off, the day was fine and fair,<br />
And to his great delight he found no dampness in the air.<br />
You know if he gets wet, a Macaroni Man is spoiled,<br />
And if he stands too near the steam, of course he may get boiled.<br />
But our hero used precautions,&mdash;carefully he shunned the spray,&mdash;<br />
And when the steam blew toward him, he just steered the other way.<br />
Now, as the breeze was from the land, his course lay out to sea;<br />
He sailed so far that he felt sure he would be late for tea.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
He sailed, and sailed, and sailed, and sailed,&mdash;he feared the dew would fall&mdash;<br />
He tried to turn,&mdash;but oh, that steam! it would not do at all!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
A single puff blew toward him, and it nearly cooked his face!<br />
The mournful Macaroni Man felt sadly out of place.<br />
But a happy thought occurred to him, &ldquo;Ha, ha,&mdash;ho, ho!&rdquo; said he,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;I&#8217;ll just sail on around the world,&mdash;and then, it seems to me,<br />
I&#8217;ll reach my home (according to a careful estimate)<br />
In time for tea, although I&#8217;ll be perhaps a trifle late.&rdquo;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Then merrily his gallant ship sped o&#8217;er the bounding main,<br />
Quickly he crossed the ocean wide, he flew by France and Spain;<br />
Covered the Mediterranean, spanned the Suez Canal,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;I&#8217;ll reach my home to-night,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;oh, yes, I&#8217;m sure I shall.&rdquo;<br />
He skimmed the Red Sea like a bird,&mdash;the Indian Ocean crossed<br />
(But once, in Oceanica, he feared that he was lost).</p>

Still at full speed, he sailed due north, he rounded Cape St. Roque,<br />
Crossed the equator, and found out the Gulf Stream was no joke.<br />
He coasted by the seaboard States. Hurrah! all danger past,<br />
Quickly he sailed the last few miles and reached his home at last;<br />
His mother welcomed him, and said, &ldquo;I&#8217;m glad there was no shower;<br />
But hurry in, my bonny boy, I&#8217;ve waited tea an hour.&rdquo;</p>

  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">When suddenly a rat arose</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who said he could a plan propose</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which would, he thought, succeed</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And meet their urgent need.</span></p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 12em;">
Now as this rat was very small,<br />
And had no dignity at all,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Although his plan was well advised,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">We really need not be surprised</span><br />
That all the rats of riper years<br />
Expressed the gravest doubts and fears;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till suddenly</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">He said, said he,</span><br />
&ldquo;If you will leave it all to me,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">I will avow</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Three days from now</span><br />
That you shall all be free.&rdquo;<br />
The solemn council then adjourned.<br />
Each rat to home and fireside turned;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But each shook his wise head</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to his neighbor said:</span><br />
&ldquo;It is a dangerous job, in truth,<br />
Though it seems naught to headstrong youth.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 12em;">
Now young Sir Rat we next behold,<br />
With manner brave and visage bold,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Go marching down</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">To London town,</span><br />
Where wondrous things are sold.<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">We see him stop</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">At a large shop,</span><br />
And with the bland clerk&#8217;s courteous aid<br />
This was the purchase that he made:<br />
A bicycle of finest make,<br />
With modern gear and patent brake,<br />
Pedometer, pneumatic tire,<br />
And spokes that looked like silver wire,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">A lantern bright</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">To shine at night,</span><br />
Enamel finish, nickel plate,<br />
And all improvements up to date.<br />
Said sly Sir Rat: &ldquo;It suits me well,<br />
Especially that sweet-toned <em>bell</em>.&rdquo;</p>

The shades of night were falling fast<br />
When Sir Rat turned toward home at last.<br />
The neighbors watched him as he passed<br />
And said: &ldquo;What is that queer-shaped thing?<br />
Surely that can&#8217;t be made to ring.&rdquo;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sir Rat went on, nor stayed</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hear the jests they made;</span><br />
And just outside the old cat&#8217;s gate<br />
He stopped and boldly braved his fate,<br />

  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For if that cat</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should smell a rat</span><br />
How quickly he&#8217;d come out and catch him,<br />
And with what gusto he&#8217;d despatch him!<br />
Sir Rat, against the picket-fence<br />
Leaned the machine, then hurried hence,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hid himself with glee,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And waited breathlessly</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">To see what that</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cantankerous cat</span><br />
Would say, when in the twilight dim<br />
He saw that brightly shining rim.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 12em;">
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sir Rat, though hidden quite,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And safely out of sight,</span><br />
Had scarcely time to wink his eye,<br />
When Mr. Cat came sauntering by.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 12em;">
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">&ldquo;Ha! Ha!&rdquo; said he,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">&ldquo;What&#8217;s this I see,</span><br />
A bicycle! and just my size!<br />
Well, this, indeed, is a surprise!<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">I&#8217;ll confiscate</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">This treasure great;</span><br />
How quickly I&#8217;ll fly o&#8217;er the ground<br />
When I pursue my hunting round!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 12em;">
He mounted it with eager haste,<br />
It suited well his sporting taste;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He guided it at will,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And used the brake with skill,</span><br />
He grasped the handle-bars, and then&mdash;<br />
You see it was his custom when<br />
He did a thing, to do it well&mdash;<br />
Of course he used the clear-toned bell!</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
Triangular Tommy, one morning in May,<br />
Went out for a walk on the public highway.<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Just here I will say,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">&#8217;Twas a bright sunny day,</span><br />
And the sky it was blue, and the grass it was green,<br />
The same sky and grass that you&#8217;ve all of you seen;<br />
And the birds in the trees sang their usual song,<br />
And Triangular Tommy went trudging along.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">But I can tell you</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">He cared naught for the view.</span><br />
He did just what small boys of his age always do:<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">He shouted out &ldquo;Scat!&rdquo;</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">At a wandering cat,</span><br />
And he picked a big daisy to stick in his hat;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">The clovers he topped,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the toadstools he cropped,</span><br />
And sometimes he scuffled and sometimes he hopped.</p>

He took an old stick and poked at a worm,<br />
And merrily chuckled to see the thing squirm;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
When he chanced to look up, and in gorgeous array<br />
Triangular Tilly was coming his way.<br />
Triangular Tom straightened up in a jiff,<br />
And put on his best manner&mdash;exceedingly stiff;<br />
And as far as his angular shape would allow<br />
Triangular Tom made a beautiful bow.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
Triangular Tilly went smilingly by,<br />
With a glance that was friendly, but just a bit shy.<br />
And Tom so admired her that after she passed,<br />
A backward look over his shoulder he cast.<br />
And he said, &ldquo;Though I think many girls are but silly,<br />
I really admire that Triangular Tilly.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
But soon all such thoughts were put out of his head,<br />
For who should come by but Triangular Ted,<br />
The very boy Tom had been wishing to see!<br />
&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Triangular Tommy, said he.<br />
&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Triangular Ted, and away<br />
Those two children scooted to frolic and play.<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And they had, on the green,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where &#8217;twas all dry and clean,</span><br />
The best game of leap-frog that ever was seen.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Triangular Tom beat down this way, you know,<br />
And Triangular Ted stood beside him, just so,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">When one, two, three&mdash;go!</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">With  the  greatest gusto,</span><br />
Ted flew over Tom in a manner not slow.</p>

    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">With his hat on one side,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And his shoe-lace untied&mdash;</span><br />
A surly old fellow, it can&#8217;t be denied;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And each wicked boy</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thought that he would enjoy</span><br />
An occasion the thoughtful old man to annoy,<br />
And all of his wise calculations destroy.<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">So they thought they&#8217;d employ</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">A means known to each boy.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>

Exceedingly strong but exceedingly fine;<br />

Old Schoolmaster Jones came down with a crash.<br />

Leaving Tommy to face the old gentleman&#8217;s rage,<br />
Who quickly jumped up,&mdash;he was brisk for his age,&mdash;<br />

Triangular Tommy fast took to his heels.<br />
Now Tommy was agile and Tommy was spry;<br />
He whizzed through the air&mdash;he just seemed to fly;<br />
He rushed madly on, until, dreadful to say!<br />
He came where the railroad was just in his way&mdash;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And alas! and alack!</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">He tripped on the track</span><br />
And then with a terrible, sudden ker-thwack!<br />
Triangular Tommy sprawled flat on his back&mdash;<br />
And the train came along with a crash, and a crack,<br />
A din, and a clatter, a clang, and a clack,<br />
A toot, and a boom, and a roar, and a hiss,<br />
And chopped him up all into pieces like this&mdash;<br />
If <em>you</em> cut out papers just like them, why, then,<br />
If you try, you can put him together again.</p>

At the thought of the topsy-turvy Spring.<br />
&ldquo;&#8217;Tis a fair exchange,&rdquo; he said, with a wink&mdash;<br />

<h2>The Strike of the Fireworks</h2>


<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 4em;">
&#8217;Twas the night before the Fourth of July, the people slept serene;<br />
The fireworks were stored in the old town hall that stood on the village green.<br />
The steeple clock tolled the midnight hour, and at its final stroke,<br />
The fire in the queer old-fashioned stove lifted its voice and spoke;<br />
&ldquo;The earth and air have naught to do, the water, too, may play,<br />
And only fire is made to work on Independence Day.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 4em;">
&ldquo;I won&#8217;t stand such injustice! It&#8217;s wrong, beyond a doubt,<br />
And I shall take my holiday. Good-by, I&#8217;m going out!&rdquo;<br />
Up spoke a Roman candle then, &ldquo;The principle is right!<br />
Suppose we strike, and all agree we will not work to-night!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;My stars!&rdquo; said a small sky-rocket. &ldquo;What an awful time there&#8217;ll be,<br />
When the whole town comes together to-night, the great display to see!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 4em;">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let them come,&rdquo; said a saucy pinwheel, &ldquo;yes, let them come if they like,<br />
As a delegate I&#8217;ll announce to them that the fireworks are going to strike!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said a small cap-pistol, &ldquo;this movement is all wrong,&mdash;<br />
Gunpowder, noise, and fireworks to Fourth of July belong.<br />
My great ancestral musket made Independence Day,<br />
I frown on your whole conspiracy, and you are wrong, I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 4em;">
And so they talked and they argued, some for and some against,&mdash;<br />
And they progressed no further than they were when they commenced.<br />
Until in a burst of eloquence a queer little piece of punk<br />
Arose in his place and said, &ldquo;I think we ought to show some spunk.<br />
And I for one have decided, although I am no shirk,<br />
That to-day is a legal holiday and not even fire should work.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 4em;">
&ldquo;And I am of some importance,&rdquo;&mdash;here he gave a pretentious cough,<br />
&ldquo;For without my assistance none of you could very well be put off.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the Roman candle, &ldquo;and I think we are all agreed<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
To strike for our rights and our liberty. Hurrah! we shall succeed!&rdquo;<br />
The dissenters cried with one accord, &ldquo;Our objections we withdraw.<br />
Hurrah, hurrah for the fireworks&#8217; strike!&rdquo; and they cried again, &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 4em;">
Then a match piped up with a tiny voice, &ldquo;Your splendid scheme I like.<br />
I agree with all your principles and so I, too, will strike!&rdquo;<br />
Suiting the action to the word, the silly little dunce<br />
Clambered down from his matchsafe and excitedly struck at once.<br />
He lost his head, and he ran around among the fireworks dry,<br />
And he cried, &ldquo;Hurrah for the fireworks&#8217; strike! Hurrah for the Fourth of July!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 4em;">
With his waving flame he lit the punk&mdash;a firecracker caught a spark,&mdash;<br />
Then rockets and wheels and bombs went off&mdash;no longer the place was dark!<br />
The explosions made a fearful noise, the flames leaped high and higher,<br />
The village folk awoke and cried, &ldquo;The town hall is on fire!&rdquo;<br />
So the strike of the fireworks ended in a wonderful display<br />
Of pyrotechnic grandeur on Independence Day!</p>

<h2>A Dream Lesson</h2>


<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
Once there was a little boy who wouldn&#8217;t go to bed,<br />
When they hinted at the subject he would only shake his head,<br />
When they asked him his intentions, he informed them pretty straight<br />
That he wouldn&#8217;t go to bed at all, and Nursey needn&#8217;t wait.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
As their arguments grew stronger, and their attitude more strict,<br />
I grieve to say that naughty boy just yelled and screamed and kicked.<br />
And he made up awful faces, and he told them up and down<br />
That he wouldn&#8217;t go to bed for all the nurses in the town.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
Then Nursey lost her patience, and although it wasn&#8217;t right,<br />
Retorted that for all she cared he might sit up all night.<br />
He approved of this arrangement, and he danced a jig for joy,<br />
And turned a somersault with glee; he <em>was</em> a naughty boy.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
And so they all went off to bed and left him sitting there,<br />
Right in the corner by the fire in Grandpa&#8217;s big armchair.<br />
He read his books and played his games,&mdash;he even sang a song<br />
And thought how lovely it would be to sit up all night long.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 196px;">
<img src="images/img78-1.png" width="196" height="270" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
But soon his games grew stupid, and his puzzles<br />
 <span style="margin-left: 3em;">wouldn&#8217;t work;</span><br />
He drew himself up stiffly with a sudden little jerk,<br />
And he said, &ldquo;I am not sleepy, and I love to<br />
 <span style="margin-left: 3em;">play alone&mdash;</span><br />
And&mdash;I&mdash;think&mdash;&rdquo; the rest was mumbled in<br />
 <span style="margin-left: 3em;">a drowsy monotone.</span></p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
He leaned back on the cushions like that night<br />
 <span style="margin-left: 3em;">he had the croup;</span><br />
His head began to wobble and his eyes began<br />
 <span style="margin-left: 3em;">to droop;</span><br />
He closed them for a minute, just to see how<br />
 <span style="margin-left: 3em;">it would seem,</span><br />
And straightway he was sound asleep, and dreamed this awful dream!</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
He thought he saw a garden filled with flowers and roses gay,<br />
A great big gardener with a hoe came walking down his way;<br />
&ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; exclaimed the gardener, as he clutched him by the head,<br />
&ldquo;Here&#8217;s a fine specimen I&#8217;ve found; I&#8217;ll plant him in this bed!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 265px;">
<img src="images/img79-1.png" width="265" height="260" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
He held the boy in one big hand, unheeding how he cried,<br />
And with the other dug a hole enormous, deep, and wide.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
He jammed the little fellow in, and said in gruffest tone,<br />
&ldquo;This is the bed for naughty boys who won&#8217;t go to their own.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
And then the dirt was shovelled in,&mdash;it covered up his toes,<br />
His ankles, knees, and waist and arms, and higher yet it rose.<br />
For still the gardener shovelled on, not noticing his cries;<br />
It came up to his chin and mouth&mdash;it almost reached his eyes;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 6em;">
Just then he gathered all his strength and gave an awful scream,<br />
And woke himself, and put an end to that terrific dream.<br />
And he said, as Nursey tucked him up and bade him snugly rest,<br />
&ldquo;When I am planted in a bed, I like my own the best.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Brother, explain to me, I pray,<br />

Why no one likes me as well as you,<br />
No matter what I may say or do.<br />
I have stores of knowledge packed in my head;<br />
I am learned and wise and very well read;<br />
I can dance, I can sing, I&#8217;m extremely polite;<br />
I am worth a large fortune all in my own right.<br />
But still,&mdash;and this question has caused me much thought,&mdash;<br />
While I am neglected, you&#8217;re everywhere sought.&rdquo;<br />
Monsieur Elims replied: &ldquo;My dear sir, that is true,<br />
But you see, I am I, and you see, you are you.<br />
If I receive praises and you receive blame,<br />
&#8217;Tis doubtless because each lives up to his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 3em;">

<h2>The Two Friends</h2>


<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 5em;">
A Spider and a Centipede went out to take a walk;<br />
The Centipede said frankly, &ldquo;I will listen while you talk,<br />
But I may appear distracted, or assume a vacant stare,<br />
Because to keep my feet in step requires my constant care.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 8em;">
    Said the Spider: &ldquo;I appreciate your most peculiar case,<br />
    And your feet must be quite handy when you want to run a race;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
    But though you gain in some ways, in some other ways you lose;<br />
    And, of course, my friend, you must be quite extravagant in shoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Ah! yes. Ah! yes,&rdquo; a heavy sigh escaped the Centipede;<br />
&ldquo;And I have other trials, too;&mdash;my life is hard indeed!<br />
Why, sometimes when I&#8217;m very tired, a long, long time it takes<br />
To ascertain with certainty which foot it is that aches.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;And when I go to dancing-class on Saturdays at three,<br />
I find the First Position very difficult for me.<br />
Though I put my best foot foremost, and good time I try to keep,<br />
To my chagrin, I often find a foot or two asleep.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 8em;">
    Athletics I attempted, but, alas! I must admit<br />
    That every exercise I tried I put my foot in it.<br />
    I think I&#8217;ll join a foot-ball team,&mdash;as many friends suggest,&mdash;<br />
    Before I&#8217;ve one foot in the grave and gout in all the rest.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 5em;">
But now I&#8217;ll say good-morning; for, my friend, I have to stop<br />
To get my boots blacked neatly at this little boot-black&#8217;s shop;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
And, as you may imagine, it will keep me here some time,<br />
But, what is worse, I&#8217;ll have to pay him many a hard-earned dime.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 8em;">
    The Spider said good-morning, and pursued his way alone,<br />
    And as he went he murmured, in a thoughtful undertone:<br />
    &ldquo;I&#8217;m a happy little Spider, and I&#8217;m very glad indeed,<br />
    That I was born an octoped and not a centipede!&rdquo;</p>

There&#8217;s always some one who will say,<br />
&ldquo;Just see that mercury to-day!&rdquo;<br />
And whether toward the top I crawl<br />
Or down toward zero I may fall,<br />
They always fret, and say that I<br />
Am far too low or far too high.<br />
Although I try with all my might,<br />
I never seem to strike it right.<br />
Now I admit it seems to me<br />
They show great inconsistency.<br />
But <em>they</em> imply <em>I</em> am to blame;<br />
Of course that makes my anger flame,<br />
And in a fiery fit of pique<br />
I stay at ninety for a week.<br />
Or sometimes in a dull despair,<br />
I give them just a frigid stare;<br />

My spirits down to zero sink.<br />

<h2>The Instructiphone</h2>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
There was a youthful genius once, a boy of thirteen years,<br />
Named Cyrus Franklin Edison Lavoisier De Squeers.<br />
To study he was not inclined, for fun he had a bent;<br />
But there was just one article he wanted to invent.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;It&#8217;s a sort of a contraption which will work itself,&rdquo; he said,<br />
&ldquo;And, without studying, will put my lessons in my head.&rdquo;<br />
He thought and puzzled o&#8217;er his plan, he worked with might and main<br />
To utilize the wondrous schemes within his fertile brain:</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
Until at last the thing was done, and to his friends said he:<br />
&ldquo;It is the wonder of the age! Success I can foresee!<br />
My great invention is complete, and&mdash;&#8217;tis no idle vaunt&mdash;<br />
I&#8217;m sure that my Instructiphone will fill a long-felt want.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
&ldquo;The action is quite simple&mdash;I will try to make it clear:<br />
This funnel-shaped receiver I apply to my left ear;<br />
Then in this hopper I will put whate&#8217;er I wish to learn&mdash;<br />
A page of history or of Greek,&mdash;and then this crank I&#8217;ll turn.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;The topic goes into this tube, a sort of phonograph<br />
Which acts directly on my mind,&mdash;it <em>does</em>, you needn&#8217;t laugh!<br />
I do not have to think at all, for, as I pull this chain,<br />
My wonderful machine transmits the knowledge to my brain.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
The plan was good, the works were fine, and yet there was a flaw;<br />
When Cyrus turned the crank around, the neighbors watched with awe.<br />
He confidently pulled the chain with motion quick and deft;<br />
The knowledge entered his right ear&mdash;and came out at his left.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
He tried again,&mdash;a page of Greek; he tried a theme occult,&mdash;<br />
A message and an errand,&mdash;every time the same result!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Then Cyrus knew that somehow his machine had missed its aim;<br />
For though the works ran smoothly it was always just the same.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
No matter what the book might be, or what it was about,<br />
It would go in at one ear,&mdash;at the other &#8217;twould come out!<br />
So in his laboratory, baffled Cyrus sitting lone,<br />
Strives to correct the sad defect in his Instructiphone.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 10em;">
But it is my opinion, there&#8217;s no fault in the machine:<br />
The trouble is that Cyrus is like other boys I&#8217;ve seen.</p>

<h2>The Lay of the Lady Lorraine</h2>


<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
The Lady Lorraine was sweet and fair;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Lady Lorraine was young;</span><br />
She had wonderful eyes and glorious hair,<br />
And a voice of a cadence rich and rare;<br />
Oh, she was a lady beyond compare&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">By all were her praises sung,</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Till valley and plain</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Took up the refrain,</span><br />
And rang with the praise of the Lady Lorraine.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
And besides all charms of form and face,<br />
There were other attractions about Her Grace;<br />
Besides her delicate, lily-white hands,<br />
She had rolling acres and broad, rich lands;<br />
Besides her patrician coat of arms,<br />
She had far-reaching forests and fertile farms;<br />
And of many an ancient and wide domain<br />
The beautiful lady was ch&acirc;telaine.<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">So of course at her door</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">There were suitors galore;</span><br />
They came by the dozen, and came by the score.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/img129-1.png" width="298" height="351" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
They came in droves, and they came in hordes,<br />
Titled nobility,&mdash;princes, lords,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Dukes and marquises, viscounts and peers,<br />
Ambassadors, marshals, grandees, grenadiers,<br />
Barons and baronets, earls, and esquires,<br />
Illustrious sons of illustrious sires:<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">But &#8217;twas ever in vain</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">They sought to attain</span><br />
The heart and the hand of the Lady Lorraine.<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And day after day</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">They turned sadly away;</span><br />
For the Lady Lorraine continued to say,<br />
Decidedly, certainly, stubbornly, &ldquo;Nay!&rdquo;<br />
She cared not for wreaths of laurel or bay,<br />
Their titles or rent rolls or uniforms gay,<br />
Their medals or ribbons or gaudy display,<br />
Their splendid equipment, demeanor, or bearing;<br />
She observed not their manners, nor what they were wearing;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Their marvellous exploits for her had no charms:<br />
Their prowess in tourney, their valor at arms;<br />
Their wondrous achievements of brawn or of brain,&mdash;<br />
All, all were as naught to the Lady Lorraine.<br />
To each suitor she&#8217;d say, with her hand on her heart,<br />
&ldquo;Sir, I ask of you only that you will depart.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
In vain they entreated, they begged and they plead,<br />
They coaxed and besought, and they sullenly said<br />
That she was hard-hearted, unfeeling, and cruel.<br />
They challenged each other to many a duel;<br />
They scowled and they scolded, they sulked and they sighed,<br />
But they could not win Lady Lorraine for a bride.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
Now the reason for this, as you may have divined,<br />
Was because in her maidenly heart was enshrined<br />
The image of one who was just to her mind:<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Who was loving and kind,</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">To whose faults she was blind,&mdash;</span><br />
The lord of her heart, and the love of her life,<br />
To whom she had promised to be a fond wife.<br />
Her Highness was happy, for even now he<br />
Was hastening to her across the blue sea.<br />
He had written to say he was then on the way,<br />
And would greet his fair lady on Christmas day.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
&#8217;Twas Christmas eve. In the old oak hall<br />
Preparations were made for the Christmas ball.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Gay garlands were hung from ceiling and wall;<br />
The Yule log was laid, the tables arrayed,<br />
And the Lady Lorraine and her whole cavalcade,<br />
From the pompous old steward to the scullery-maid,<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Were all in a fluster,</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Excitement and bluster,</span><br />
And everything shone with a marvellous lustre.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
Such savory viands the larders presented;<br />
Such wondrous confections the bakers invented:<br />
Such pasties and cates of eccentric design;<br />
Such sparkling decanters of rarest old wine;<br />
And ready at hand was the great wassail-bowl,<br />
And the jolly old boar&#8217;s head, with lemon, so droll.<br />
The nook for musicians was carefully planned,<br />
And carols and glees would be played by the band.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 65px; margin-top: -5em; margin-right: 3em;">
<img src="images/img131-2.png" width="65" height="77" alt="image" title="" />

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
At last all was ready. The workmen were done;<br />
And awaiting the jollity, mirth, and frivolity,<br />
The games and the dancing, the feasting and fun,<br />
The old hall was empty,&mdash;save only for one,&mdash;<br />
The Lady Lorraine, who surveyed it with pride,<br />
And said, &ldquo;It is worthy of Lord Cecil&#8217;s bride!&rdquo;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Then a bright smile illumined her happy young face,<br />
Her roguish eyes twinkled, and gayly Her Grace<br />
Crossed the old polished floor with a step light and quick,<br />
And her high slipper heels went clickety-click.<br />
She looked cautiously round,&mdash;she was all by herself;<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Like a mischievous elf,</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">She took from a shelf</span><br />
A mistletoe spray with its berries like pearls;<br />
Then tossing her head and shaking her curls,<br />
In a manner half daring and yet half afraid,<br />
The madcap maid, with a smile that betrayed<br />
Expectant thoughts of her lover dear,<br />
Fastened the spray to the chandelier.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
Then in a merry, fanciful mood,<br />
Inspired by the time and the solitude,<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">The Lady Lorraine,</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">In whimsical vein,</span><br />
Said, &ldquo;On Christmas eve, &#8217;neath this mistletoe bough,<br />
I&#8217;ll solemnly make an immutable vow.&rdquo;<br />
With a glance at the portraits that hung on the wall,<br />
She said, &ldquo;I adjure ye to witness, all:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
I vow by the names that I&#8217;ve long revered,&mdash;<br />
By my great-great-grandfather&#8217;s great gray beard,<br />
By my father&#8217;s sword, by my uncle&#8217;s hat,<br />
By my spinster aunt&#8217;s Angora cat,<br />
By my ancient grandame&#8217;s buckled shoes,<br />
By my uncle Gregory&#8217;s marvellous brews,<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">By Sir Sydney&#8217;s wig,</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And his ruff so big,&mdash;</span><br />
Indeed, by his whole preposterous rig,&mdash;<br />
By the scutcheon and crest, and all the rest<br />
Of the signs of my house, I vow this vow:<br />
That whoever beneath this mistletoe bough<br />
Shall first kiss me, he&mdash;none but he&mdash;<br />
My partner for life shall henceforth be.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
She had scarcely ceased when she heard a sound.<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">She looked around,</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And, startled, found</span><br />
From the old oak chimney place it came.<br />
For there, as if in an old oak frame,<br />
A figure quaint, yet familiar too,<br />
Met her astonished, bewildered view.<br />
Of aspect merry, yet something weird,<br />
With kind blue eyes and a long white beard,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Fur-trimmed cloak, and a peak&egrave;d cap,<br />
Rosy cheeks,&mdash;a jolly old chap;<br />
And, though surprised, she recognized<br />
St. Nicholas, dear to her childhood days,<br />
And she met his smile with a welcome gaze.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
The jolly old man beheld Her Grace,<br />
With her laughing eyes and her winsome face;<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">He couldn&#8217;t resist her,&mdash;</span><br />
        <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Indeed, who could?&mdash;</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And he heartily kissed her</span><br />
        <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Where she stood!</span><br />
And exultingly cried, &ldquo;I heard your vow;<br />
And Lady Lorraine shall be <em>my</em> bride now!&rdquo;</p>

The lady trembled, as in a daze;<br />
With a startled gaze of blank amaze,<br />
She looked at the figure who stood by her side<br />
And audaciously claimed her for his bride.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Then she bowed her head</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And the color fled</span><br />
From the cheeks that his kiss had flushed rosy red.<br />
Her heart was filled with a sad despair<br />
As she thought of her lover, Lord Cecil Clare,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And his dire dismay</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">When on Christmas day</span><br />
He should ride up gayly in brave array,<br />
And find his sweetheart stolen away.</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
But the honor and pride of her race were at stake;<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And for conscience&#8217; sake</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">She dared not break</span><br />
Her solemn vow, though her heart might ache.<br />
To be true to her word, her sire had taught her,<br />
And she was a loyal, obedient daughter.<br />
She appealed to the portraits of squires and dames,<br />
Who looked sternly down from their gilded frames;<br />
But they seemed to say, &ldquo;There must ne&#8217;er be broken<br />
A promise or vow a Lorraine has spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
With stifled sighs, and with tears in her eyes,<br />
Though she tried to assume a cheerful guise,<br />
She turned to the suitor who stood apart,<br />
Awaiting the gift of her hand and heart;<br />
And she said with a gentle, dignified air:<br />
&ldquo;My heart belongs to Lord Cecil Clare;<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">But my fatal vow,</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Though I rue it now,</span><br />
I dare not break. So, at your command,<br />
I fulfil it! On you I bestow my hand.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;O noble lady!&rdquo; her suitor cried,<br />

      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Full well I knew</span><br />

Behold your lover, my bonny bride!<br />
I assumed this guise for a Christmas joke.&rdquo;<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And as he spoke,</span><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">He threw off his cloak,</span><br />
He flung to the floor his peak&egrave;d hood,<br />
And a gallant knight before her stood!</p>

He doffed his wig and his long white beard;<br />
All signs of St. Nicholas disappeared;<br />
And smiling there, in the firelight&#8217;s glare,<br />

<p class="poem" style="margin-left: 11em;">
The lady marvelled&mdash;a glad surprise<br />
Betokened itself in her lovely eyes;<br />
And with her merriment quite restored,<br />

By the knight and the lady, and every one said,<br />
With a shout that rent the midnight air,<br />
&ldquo;Long live Lord Cecil and Lady Clare!&rdquo;</p>
